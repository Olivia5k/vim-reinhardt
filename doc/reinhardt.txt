INTRODUCTION					*reinhardt*
						*reinhardt-introduction*

Whenever you edit a file in a Django application, this plugin will be
automatically activated.  This sets various options and defines a few
buffer-specific commands.

This plugin has been highly inspired by the vim-rails plugin by Tim Pope,
which is very evident if one takes just a bare little look.

If you are in a hurry to get started, with a minimal amount of reading, you
are encouraged to at least skim through the headings and command names in this
file, to get a better idea of what is offered.  If you only read one thing,
make sure it is the navigation section: |reinhardt-navigation|.

NOTE: It should be noted that this plugin is currently only in its infancy.
While it is already possible to use it for day-to-day development, it is under
heavy development and many things will be added or changed. See the included
todo file under vimwiki/reinhardt.vimwiki for more information.

GENERAL COMMANDS				*reinhardt-commands*

All commands are buffer local, unless otherwise stated.  This means you must
actually edit a file from a reinhardt application.

						*reinhardt-:Reinhardt*
:Reinhardt		The only global command.  It is a wrapper around
			manage.py, with completion for the default commands
			and any management commands defined by applications
			found in the current project (if any).

						*reinhardt-:Rcd*
:Rcd [{directory}]	|:cd| to /path/to/app/{directory}.
			Without arguments, |:cd| to project root.

						*reinhardt-:Rlcd*
:Rlcd [{directory}]	|:lcd| to /path/to/app/{directory}.
			Without arguments, |:lcd| to project root.


NAVIGATION					*reinhardt-navigation*

Navigation is where the real power of this plugin lies.  Efficient use of the
following features will greatly ease navigating the Django file structure.

File Under Cursor - gf ~
						*reinhardt-gf*
The |gf| command, which normally edits the current file under the cursor, has
been remapped to take context into account. |CTRL-W_f| (open in new window)
and |CTRL-W_gf| (open in new tab) are also remapped.

Example uses of |gf|, and where they might lead.
(* indicates cursor position)
>
	index*.html
<	app/templates/index.html ~
>
	_('translation-k*ey')
<	app/locale/en/LC_MESSAGES/django.po; row of key definition ~


File Type Navigation Commands ~
						*reinhardt-type-navigation*
Each of the upcoming commands takes an optional argument (with tab completion)
but defaults to a reasonable guess.  Commands that default to the current
model or controller generally behave like you'd expect in other file types.

Each of the following commands has variants for splitting, vertical splitting,
and opening in a new tab.  For :Rmodel, those variants would be :RSmodel,
:RVmodel and :RTmodel.  There is also :REmodel which is a synonym for :Rmodel
(future versions might allow customization of the behavior of :Rmodel).

:Radmin						|reinhardt-:Radmin|
:Rfixture					|reinhardt-:Rfixture|
:Rform						|reinhardt-:Rform|
:Rlocale					|reinhardt-:Rlocale|
:Rmanage					|reinhardt-:Rmanage|
:Rmiddle					|reinhardt-:Rmiddle|
:Rmodel						|reinhardt-:Rmodel|
:Rmodel						|reinhardt-:Rmodel|
:Rstatic					|reinhardt-:Rstatic|
:Rtemplate					|reinhardt-:Rtemplate|
:Rtest						|reinhardt-:Rtest|
:Rurl						|reinhardt-:Rurl|
:Rutil						|reinhardt-:Rutil|
:Rview						|reinhardt-:Rview|

						*reinhardt-:Radmin*
						*reinhardt-:Rform*
						*reinhardt-:Rmiddle*
						*reinhardt-:Rmodel*
						*reinhardt-:Rtest*
						*reinhardt-:Rurl*
						*reinhardt-:Rutil*
						*reinhardt-:Rview*
:Radmin [{...}]		Edit the Python source file for the given command.
			If the file happens to be a directory (e.g. views/
			rather than views.py) browse the directory instead.
			If |snakeskin| is installed, the commands gain
			completion for functions and classes inside the files.
			See |reinhardt-snakeskin| for more detils.
			If |snakeskin| is not installed, the commands take one
			app name as an argument and switches to that app
			before opening the file.

						*reinhardt-:Rfixture*
:Rfixture [{name}]	With no argument, open fixtures/initial_data.json.
			If intial_data.json is not the only file in the
			directory, browse the directory.
			If an argument is given, open fixtures/{name}.

						*reinhardt-:Rlocale*
:Rlocale [{lang}]	Edit the django.po file for the current language.
			Takes an optional language code as an argument and
			switches the current language to it before opening
			the file.
			If no argument is given and no language is selected,
			choose the first one in app/locale.  If none exists,
			default to english.

INTEGRATION					*reinhardt-integration*

reinhardt provides integration into other vim plugins.

						*reinhardt-snakeskin*
Snakeskin (https://github.com/thiderman/vim-snakeskin)
Provides quick analysis of Python file structures without requiring |+python|.
If found by reinhardt, the Python file family of navigation commands
(|:Rmodel| etc) will gain navigation and tab completion for classes and
functions.

:Rmodel Blog get_absolute_url ~
Would take you to the definition of get_absolute_url under the class Blog in
your models.

						*reinhardt-linguist*
Linguist (https://github.com/thiderman/vim-linguist)
Provides quick analysis of .po file structures.
If found by reinhardt, it will gain additional i18n powers;
The |reinhardt-gf| command will gain navigation to translation keys in .po
files for the current language and a translation HUD message echoed whenever
on a row containing a translation string.
(See http://quickfast.ninjaloot.se/img/i18n.png for an example.)

Having linguist will also define these commands:

						*reinhardt-:Rlang*
:Rlang {lang}		Switches the current language to {lang}.

						*reinhardt-:Rlangnext*
						*reinhardt-:Rlangprev*
:Rlangprev		Cycles to the next available language. Uses
			directories under app/locale to determine what
			languages to cycle between.
